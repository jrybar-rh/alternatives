## Description
This is a reimplementation of [chkconfig/alternatives](https://github.com/fedora-sysv/chkconfig)

Alternatives is a tool to switch between different versions of specific software installed on a system.
The switch is basically done by changing symlinks used to execute desired software binaries to point to particular binary of desired version.
Alternatives can track multiple versions of multiple software. Each software can define its versions in specific configuration file (see FILES section).

## Reporting bugs
There are a few ways of reporting bugs or feature requests:
- ~~Your distributions bug reporter. If you are using a distribution your first
port of call is their bug tracker. This is because each distribution has their
own patches and way of dealing with bugs. Also bug reporting often does not need
any subscription to websites.~~
- Github Issues
